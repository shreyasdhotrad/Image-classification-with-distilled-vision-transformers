Visual selective attention is of great importance in the mechanism of human visual
system, since it can guide us to grasp the most important content within the scene and
enable the visual system to obtain useful information with limited processing resources.
The same attention mechanism becomes crucial in generation of image, target detection,
scene classification and tracking when applied in the field of computer vision.The new
state of the art self-supervised methods can discover and segment objects in an image or
a video with absolutely no supervision and is capable of achieving higher level of image
understanding. Considering the Drawbacks of the contrastive learning approach and the
Motivation for the attention we propose to implement the DINO approach. Here in the
DINO approach we basically deal with the Attention Mechanism which helps us to
overcome the contrastive learning approach.In this context, we propose to optimize the
process of categorization of data by applying attention to self-supervised learning
methods.
